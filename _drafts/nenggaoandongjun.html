    <h2>Before you begin</h2>
    <h3>Trail entrances</h3>
    The hike is usually done North to South. The North entrance is at Tunyuan (屯原):<br>

      <li><a href="https://goo.gl/maps/NBPYF8gyM4PiHPQC6">Google Maps</a></li>
    </ul>
    The end is at Aowanda (奧萬大):<br>

      <li><a href="https://goo.gl/maps/atwghpn88xFThgmW8">Google Maps</a></li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Transportation and Parking</h3>
    <p>
      It's difficult to do this hike without a car. You can try hitchhiking, but the road leading to
      the north entrance is used almost solely by hikers. Aowanda is quite popular so it might be
      easier to hitch a ride from there. If you drive your own car you'll still need to hire another driver to
      drive you back to your car.
    </p>
    <p>
      There are a few small parking lots at the entrance, but on busy
      weekends it might be difficult to find a spot. Keep going up until you find something making
      sure you don't block other cars. Another option is parking in Aowanda and having a driver help
      to get you to the entrance. This is less optimal for a few reasons:
      <ol>
        <li>
          There is a fee to enter Aowanda. You can always park on the road outside of the park,
          but there isn't that many spots and it means more walking after you finish.
        </li>
        <li>
          If weather turns bad on first or early second day and you need to retreat you'll have to
          use the driver again to get back to your car.
        </li>
        <li>
          You'll have to spend more time in the morning on first day. If you want to do this in 4 days the first days is quite long so it's
          probably better to get more sleep or spend that time hiking. Not that big of an issue if you're planning more days and staying at
          Tianchi Lodge (天池山莊) for your first night.
        </li>
      </ol>
    </p>
    <h3>Accommodation</h3>
    <p>
      Depending on your itinerary and hiking speed you might have to stay a night somewhere close to the
      entrance. A good option is Lushan Hot Spring Village (廬山溫泉), it has a lot of hotels and
      B&amp;Bs with different pricing. We stayed at
      <a href="https://goo.gl/maps/gAJwQx9DXBDsFSmn7">Lilai Hot Spring Hotel</a> Like a lot of
      hotels in Taiwan the place isn't great, but it's cheap and breakfast is provided as early at
      night as you want. It also has small bathtub with hot spring water in the room. After the hike
      you can come back here and take a shower for 100NT.
    </p>

    <h2>Day 1</h2>
    <p>
      We woke up and had our breakfast at the hotel at 4, hopped on the car and after a short drive were lucky enough to find a parking spot
      at the second parking lot. We were on the trail shortly after 5. First half of the first day is spent on the Nenggao Cross Trail
      (能高越嶺古道), an old way between Puli and Hualien. The trail is in an excellent condition - so excellent in fact that motorbikes are
      used to cover the 13km from the trailhead to Tianchi cabin (天池山莊) to deliver supplies. Thanks to the wide road you can cover this
      distance relatively fast. After about 1.5h (4.8km in) we reached Yunhai (雲海保線所), an old cabin and a common resting stop. It would take us
      another 3h to reach Tianchi Cabin, passing massive landslides and waterfalls of different sizes. Nenggao waterfall, the biggest of
      them all, sits right before the cabin.
    </p>
    <p>
      We took a short rest at Tianchi as Tati and I finally caught up with our faster companions Ada and Peggy. After a brief lunch we moved out continuing
      on the wide track for a bit longer. It takes about an hour from here to reach a well known landmark and a perfect example of how Chinese doesn't
      work great translated directly into English: "Monument of Spread Light Across the Land" (光被八表). It lies in the saddle
      between Nanhua and Nenggao peaks, with the former sometimes referred to as Nenggao North Peak. This is the highest point of Nenggao
      Cross Trail and is the point where our trail would split from it. Yet another split from here leads up to
      Nanhua and continues north to Qilai peaks. We wouldn't see a road this good for the next few days. In addition to the monument you'll
      see electricity towers crossing the mountains from East to West.
    </p>
    <p>
      One of the worst sections of this hike begins here with bamboo and other short vegetation blocking your way forward. Watch out for
      occasional holes in the ground (really easy to twist your ankle on those) and stones and branches at the inconvenient level of your
      knees. There is an electricity tower you can see in the distance, that's your next target and rest stop. After the tower continue
      upwards and upwards until the trail begins to clear up just a bit with dwarf bamboo taking over other shrubs. You'll also start noticing
      small lakes scattered around. You're getting close to your first peak above 3000m on this trail: Kaheer Mt (卡賀爾山) at 3105m. It's a curious
      looking peak, or rather a collection of peaks. The main trail doesn't go through any of them, but it's only about 2 minute hike up to
      the main peak. After this
      mountain you'll have to go down a bit and start another climb, this time finally to the main peak of Nenggao Mt (能高山) and your
      first Top 100 mountain on this trip. The mountains look close to each other on the map, but it still took us over 2h to reach the
      peak. By the time we got there the weather cleared up a bit, but it was also getting late. We had to hurry to our first
      campground, the China Lake (大陸池).
    </p>
    <p>
      The descent from Nenggao Main Peak is as tiring as the ascent was. You'll notice plenty of small lakes around and if you're coming on busy
      weekend like we did there'll be tents strewn across the mountain. If it's getting dark it's better you find a spot to camp here,
      there should be plenty of water around if you don't come in dry season. We pushed on downhill with an occasional flattening or a minor
      bump, pushing through the undergrowth until we got a glimpse of our campground. The small area that hosts China lake is shaped
      similarly to Kaheer mountain, with sharp peaks around the levelled campground. A mountain crown, if you will. By the time we got
      there it was pretty dark and most good spots were taken, but one friendly porter invited us to share the space next to his tent.
      The water from the lake is drinkable if you treat it, but it's so dirty it clogged my filter pretty quick.
      After a short bite it was late enough that the whole campground was asleep so we tucked in as well.
    </p>
  </section>
  <section class="clearfix">
    <h2>Day 2</h2>
    <p>
      It was around 2AM when first hikers woke up and started with their breakfast. We didn't sleep much the last few hours
      because of all the commotion, but got a bit more sleep after most hikers left waking up right before sunrise. The friendly porter from
      yesterday shared his water with us, they had enough from the fresh water source down the western slope of this hill. I haven't checked
      the source so unfortunately I'm unable to provide concrete directions. As we were preparing to leave we noticed small colourful dots on the
      next mountain - those were early risers still fighting with Nenggao South peak. We knew this would be a tough climb, but with the
      morning sun and a bit of sleep we were sure we could conquer it no problem.
    </p>
    <p>
      From the campground the trail is quite even for a while before starting the climb. There is a lot of overgrowth, but not more than
      yesterday. After a while you'll hit a few tricky bits with ropes, stash your poles so that they don't get in the way and push on.
      There is one or two sections here where it's better to wait for the previous hiker to finish their climb due to falling rocks. Apart
      from that all you can do here is climb, it'll take a while. When you reach the top and climb a few giant rocks you should be able to see the peak.
      You won't be there yet, but you got the hardest part done. Take a rest, grab a bite and enjoy the view as it is magnificent on a clear day.
      If you look back you'll notice the campground in the saddle between this mountain and Nenggao Main Peak.
      Behind that peak Nanhua and Qilai peaks, extending to Qilai East Ridge. Closer to you the Ganzhuowan (干卓萬) range will be clearly
      visible in southwestern direction. From here it would take us another 2 hours to get to the South Peak with the sun strong enough to
      force us to rest at every shaded
      location we could find. Similarly to Kaheer Mt, the peak of Nenggao South is a very short trek out of the main trail. Drop your bags,
      grab the peak and again enjoy the wonderful views from here. This is the highest you're going to be on this trip as the South Peak is
      higher than the main, sitting at 3349m. It's also one of the Top 100, one of the two you'll do on this day.
    </p>
    <p>
      After a proper lunch break (nothing beats a sandwich with fresh tomato!) it was time to head down the mountain. As you start your
      descend you'll notice a few peaks in a group in front of you - the last of those peaks is your next target. Before reaching
      it you'll have to go all the way down to the valley. This descent is very steep and seemed more painful than the way up.
      There's a lot of big holes here so be careful and take your time. There's a campground at the bottom, but more importantly if you turn
      left (east) along the river you will eventually hit fresh water. There's still a few hours ahead of you and not many water sources so make sure you get plenty.
    </p>
    <p>
      Another climb awaits, luckily not as steep as the last one. You'll reach a peak eventually, the bad news is that's not the peak you
      want. The good news is this was your last serious climb for the day since Guangtou Mt (光頭山) is actually lower than this one. In
      fact there's a bunch of peaks here, but for some reason the peak marker is not on any of them. In any case continue downhill, steep in
      places, until you hit a small campground on the left before a small uphill. Continue up and tread along until you hit another small campground,
      also on your left. After a very short while you should see some mud on the path - there is a small water source around
      here, should you need it. Push on and after another short while you'll see people on the peak. Well peak might be too big of a word
      for that, I honestly don't know what's up with this mountain. Take the pictures of your third Top 100 and the last one for the day. It was
      quite late at this time so we hurried on to the campsite.
    </p>
    <p>
      The downhill from Guangtou starts with rappelling down a cliff, we hit a small traffic jam here and had to wait for a few people to get down.
      Be careful here! About a week after our trip someone fell here and needed helicopter rescue. Be sure to stash your poles, use both arms to
      hold the line and make your way down slowly finding firm places to step on. There is a small easy landslide section after the cliff,
      but after it another gruelling
      downhill begins. It'll take about an hour of fighting through the undergrowth but eventually you'll see the tents scattered in front
      of Baishi lake (白石池). We arrived at the campsite around 5PM, happy to see Ada and Peggy again. There is plenty of lakes here, but
      there's also a "fres" water source around. Looking back on it I'm not sure it's worth the visit, particularly when it's
      cloudy. It's pretty far, tricky to find and it's a lake outlet so not particularly fresher than the alternatives. With the whole area being relatively flat and full
      of lakes it can be really difficult to find your way back when clouds roll in. In fact someone got lost that evening and it took the
      porters a while to find him. Unless the weather is crystal clear and you don't mind the hike, filter the water from the big lake.
      As the night approached the campsite got encroached by the Sambar deer, beautiful animals that this campground (and trail in general) is
      known for. Over the years they unfortunately got used to hikers feeding them and so they might approach your tent uncomfortably close.
    </p>
    <aside class="bg-blue-100 ml-5 p-3">
      As with any wildlife make sure you don't feed the deers, try not to scare or touch them either. Occasionally they'll approach you,
      usually in small groups. Don't be alarmed, they're quite big, but completely harmless. When you go to sleep make sure all your food
      and other items are inside the tent. Not under the vestibule, they'll grab that, inside the tent proper.
    </aside>
  </section>
  <section>
    <h2>Day 3</h2>
    <p>
      We woke up to an almost empty campground again, just before sunrise. Took us a while to get organised and snap some sunrise pictures,
      but eventually we headed to the trail.
      <aside class="bg-blue-100 ml-5 mb-3 p-3">
        Make sure you clean up thoroughly after yourself, the deers will be looking for any food scraps
        you might have left behind.
      </aside>
      You can see the next mountain from the lake that you camped at, Baishi Mt (白石山). Bring some water with you,
      but just enough for the morning - there's a few points to refill on the way. 
      The hike up will take a while, but it's easier than previous morning. You'll start the hike heading directly at the peak, but
      eventually will circle to the left, go through a small forest and be on top shortly after that. Rest a bit and enjoy the
      views, on a clear day you can see as far as Yushan and Mabolasi in the far south. Directly North of you you should see Central Range Point
      peeking from behind Qilai peaks and Snow range to the left of that. You'll also see the final mountain of this range and your final
      climb for today: Andongjun Mt (安東軍山) in the south. It's a beautiful hike from this peak to that one, arguably the best section of
      this whole trip.
    </p>
    <p>
      You should see quite a big lake below you and a hill after it, the hikers that got up before us were climbing it like little ants. The
      lake is called Wanli Lake (萬里池) and is the biggest of all the lakes you'll see in these few days. Make your way down the small peak next
      to this one and then further down to the lake. Once you reach the bottom you'll notice small streams here and there, there is a
      particularly good one at the end. The water is rushing quite strongly there so you should be able to notice it just by hearing, it'll be
      much louder than the other ones. Refill the water here for the next few hours and continue on to another nightmarish experience.
      The trail goes through a tall bamboo and with all the water around it's very muddy. You'll probably be careful in the
      beginnig, but this section is long enough that your shoes will eventually get muddy. After this section you'll reach a big clearing that you
      probably saw during the descent, a bit more bamboo follows and the climb begins.
    </p>
    <p>
      This part is pretty steep and seems high, but in reality it's less than 200m elevation gain.
      You'll reach a small pointy peak and from there continue traversing a few hills before eventually heading down to yet
      another lake: Tunlu Lake (屯鹿池). You'll hear some water here as well and if you really need to feel free to refill, but keep in mind
      there is a much nicer source not far from here. After you circle the lake you'll end up at a small campground, after that there will
      be another small sister lake (it literally has a "little sister" in its name) that you'll have to cross. The trail here might be a bit
      tricky, you'll want to go left (east) just before the lake, circle around by crossing some muddy ground and climb back up. Look for
      ribbons. After you cross the small ridge you'll find a stream, refill the water here. We got here around 12:30, if it's later or you
      feel tired you should probably fill in much more water here, enough for the camp soon. Cross the river and continue slightly upwards. After a
      while you'll clear all the small hills and see the intersection before the last mountain. The campsite here is literally called "Three
      way intersection campground" （三岔路口營地). Drop your bags around the lake, grab a small backpack if you have it or just a bottle of
      water if you don't and start climbing your last peak. Andongjun Mt is barely over 3000m, but this climb will still take you about an
      hour. It's worth it - the views from this peak are wonderful. You can see all the peaks you did over the last few days and the
      beautiful grassy mountains to the south. Make your way back to the intersection.
    </p>
    <p>
      By the time we finished the mountain it was around 3PM, but given that the next campground was only a few km away and all downhill we
      decided to continue. If you're here around that time or later I suggest camping here. I also suggest this place if it's rainy or about
      to rain, the other campsites might be dangerously close to the river if water level is too high. The campsite is a bit below and if you haven't
      taken any water from the previous source you can filter the one from the lake or look for a stream. I believe there should be one in
      both east and west directions. I saw porters looking for water on the west side, north of the trail going down.
      Should you decide to continue brace yourself for a steep downhill. Not much to write about this section really, just push on down.
      There are two hunter's campgrounds here, literally called hunter's campground 1 (第一獵寮) and hunter's campground 2 (第二獵寮).
      Before you reach them you have to reach a stream that you'll follow all the way to Wanda South River (萬大南溪). At first you'll hear
      a stream to your right - that's not the one you're interested in. Listen to the stream to your left, once you hear it you'll know
      you're close. Just before crossing the stream you'll notice a very small campground with a tarp on the ground. There's just enough
      space here for one or two tents, but another tent could potentially be set up on the other side of the river. Both of these are close
      to the river so be wary if it rains. Now up to this day I'm not sure if this is actually hunter's campground 1. The yellow sign you
      see here says it's not, but it's incorrect in many other regards (distances, position). In any case the next good campground is about
      3h away, unfortunately it's something we weren't aware of. We refilled our water and continued. After you cross the stream and go a
      bit below there is another place where you could potentially set up a tent or two. Continue down the river, to the other side and down
      again. Before we reached the river I was sure I was some people, but then thought my eyes were playing tricks on me. At this point I
      noticed them again though so was sure we have some hikers ahead of us. We reached the river bed again and noticed a place where we
      could set up camp. It was in the river bed so a bit risky, but the water level was low and no rain in forecast. I dropped my bag and
      wanted to set up the tent when I heard people talking. I still wasn't sure about the first campground: have we reached it already or
      is it just in front of us? With that uncertainty in mind I shouted for the people ahead to wait a bit, turned my trail running mode
      on and ran to catch up with them. They were quite surprised to see me there, but informed me that they couldn't find the first
      campground either. Bummed out I headed back, but then heard them shouting back at me "Hey there's a campground here!" It was a very
      small one, just for one tent, but it wasn't right next to the river. They decided to continue so I went back to tell Tati the good
      news and after a while we set up our tent. Finally done with this long day.
    </p>
  </section>
  <section>
    <h2>Day 4</h2>
    <p>
      We woke up just before sunrise again and headed out. We knew the road ahead was tricky and wanted to cover it with the daylight. The
      first hour or two was just more of the same - steep downhill, cross the river, steep downhill... Eventually, just after 7AM,
      we reached the second hunter's campground. This is a proper one - enough space for a few small groups and still close enough to
      the river to fetch water. Ada and Peggy spent the night here, so did the people I ran into last night. After the campground the trail
      goes up quite a bit, this climb took us by surprise. You then traverse the hill and eventually go down again to another small
      campground right next to the river. We assumed we can cross the river here, but things are never that easy here in Taiwanese
      mountains. From the campground you still have to climb up a bit and then go down again reaching the stream. Right after crossing it
      we reached a perfect spot for our late breakfast. There is a choice to be made here as there are two trails that follow. The official
      trail climbs a nearby ridge and goes parallel to the river crossing a few campgrounds. The unofficial one goes right along the river.
      The riverbed of Aowanda South River, at this point, a good few hundred meters wide with the stream itself a few meters. If the weather
      is good and water level is not too high I recommend going along the river. If it's raining hard (or has been in the previous days)
      take the high way. The split might be a bit tricky to find as most ribbons point you to the mountain trail, just go down along the
      river and look for ribbons and stacked stones.
    </p>
    <p>
      You'll have to cross this stream two times before reaching the big river. After the second crossing you'll go through a small forest
      and down to the big river. It's hard to miss, this river bed will be quite a noticable change from the few last days. Turn right and
      continue in the north direction. You'll have to cross the stream a few times. Depending on what you wear you might want to take your
      shoes off. If you're hiking in trail running shoes don't bother, they'll dry instantly and you won't waste time putting them on and
      off again. This section is about 3km long, but it's a pleasure to walk on a trail like this and shouldn't take you too long. One thing
      to mind here is the sun, make sure you put your hat on and rest in the shade. You'll notice a few streams on your right here and
      there and if you look closely you'll notice ribbons above one of the rivers. That's the mountain trail crossing, ignore it and
      continue until eventually you'll reach a place where the river narrows. Look for ribbons on the right bank and climb out of the
      riverbed entering trail again. After a short hike you'll reach a small campground just before a  small stream. This campground is the fourth and final
      one of a series that goes through the mountain route. The first one was at the split of the two routes with the other two somewhere in
      between. The stream will be your last chance to get some water for a while so use it. It won't taste great (make sure you filter it),
      but you still have ways to go. Be careful of the river mouth here, it's quite a drop from here and the calm stream that you crossed a few times is now bellowing below.
    </p>
    <p>
      I hope you missed a good climb! This section will have three points where it crosses a ridge and some of them might have reception.
      They're tricky to spot, but are essentially gentle ridges that you cross. One thing I noticed is that the wind gets much stronger at
      those spots so that's one thing to look out for. Also there is one section here with a rickety ladder right above a cliff. Make sure
      you stash your poles and be very careful going down. After the initial steep climb there will be a few ups and downs, push on. You'll
      know when you reach the third ridge crossing when you spot an information board. It's always good to see those after a few days, they
      usually indicate you're close enough to civilisation. Turn left here and go up the mild slope, then down and up again. After that it's
      a steep and a bit slippery (dry pine needles on the ground) downhill, but eventually you'll reach Aowanda Park (奧萬大). At this point
      I was sure I'm done, but there's still a bit of ground to cover.
    </p>
    <p>
      At the time we arrived the famous Aowanda Suspension Bridge (奧萬大吊橋) was closed for renovation. Luckily there is an alternative
      route, climbing down to the river and crossing it over a temporary bridge. If the suspension bridge is open when you do this hike just
      cross and make your way to the Tourist Centre (遊客服務中心). After getting out of the river bed you'll have to cross this section of
      the park and then another bridge before the final climb of this trip to the Tourist Centre. Make your way up to the second floor (more
      steps) and rest a bit in the restaurant enjoying a proper meal and a can of coke - you deserve it.
