    <h2>Before you begin</h2>
    <h3>Trail entrances</h3>
    The hike is usually done North to South. The North entrance is at Tunyuan/屯原:<br>

    </ul>
    The end is at Aowanda/奧萬大:<br>

    </ul>
    <h3>Transportation</h3>
    <p>
      It's difficult to do this hike without a car. Like always you can try hitchhiking, but the road
      from the north is pretty much used by hikers only. Aowanda is quite popular so it might be
      easier to hitch a ride from there. If you drive your own car you'll still need a driver to
      drive you back to your car. There are a few small parking lots at the entrance, but on busy
      weekends it might be difficult to find a spot. Keep going up until you find something. Make
      sure you don't block other cars. Another option is parking in Aowanda and having a driver help
      to get you to the entrance. This is less optimal for a few reasons:
      <ol>
        <li>
          There is a fee to enter Aowanda. You can always park on the road outside of the park,
          but there isn't that many spots and it means more walking after you finish.
        </li>
        <li>
          If weather turns bad on first or early second day and you need to retreat you'll have to
          use the driver again to get back to your car.
        </li>
      </ol>
    </p>
    <h3>Accommodation</h3>
    <p>
      Depending on your itinerary or speed you might have to stay a night somewhere close to the
      entrance. A good option is Lushan Hot Spring Village (廬山溫泉), it has a lot of hotels and
      B&amp;Bs with different pricing. We stayed at
      <a href="https://goo.gl/maps/gAJwQx9DXBDsFSmn7">Lilai Hot Spring Hotel</a> Like a lot of
      hotels in Taiwan the place isn't great, but it's cheap and breakfast is provided as early at
      night as you want. It also has small bathtub with hot spring water in the room. After the hike
      you can come back here and take a shower for 100NT.

    <h2>Day 1</h2>
    <p>
      We woke up and had our breakfast at the hotel at 4, hopped on the car and after a short drive were lucky enough to find a parking spot
      at the second parking lot. We were on the trail shortly after 5. We'd spend most of the first day on the Nenggao Cross Trail
      (能高越嶺古道), an old way between Puli and Hualien. The trail is in an excellent condition - so excellent in fact that motorbikes are
      used to cover the 13km from the entrance to the Tianchi cabin (天池山莊) to deliver supplies. Thanks to the wide road you can cover this
      distance relatively fast. After about 1.5h we reached Yunhai (雲海保線所), an old cabin and a common resting stop. It would take us
      another 3h to reach Tianchi Cabin, passing massive landslides and waterfalls of different sizes. Nenggao waterfall, the biggest of
      them all, is the closest one to the cabin.
    </p>
    <p>
      We took a short rest at Tianchi as Tati and I finally caught up with faster Ada and Peggy. After a short lunch we moved out continuing
      on the wide track for a bit longer. It takes about an hour to reach a well known landmark, and a perfect example of how Chinese doesn't
      work great translated directly into English: "Monument of Spread Light Across the Land" (光被八表). It lies in the saddle
      between Nanhua and Nenggao peaks, with the latter sometimes referred to as Nenggao North Peak. This is the highest point of Nenggao
      Cross Trail that I alluded to before and is the point where our trail would split from it. Yet another split from here leads up to
      Nanhua and continues north to Qilai peaks. We wouldn't see a road this good for the next few days. In addition to the monument you'll
      see electricity towers crossing the mountains from East to West.
    </p>
    <p>
      One of the worst sections of this hike begins here with bamboo and other short vegetation blocking your way forward. Watch out for
      occasional holes in the ground (really easy to twist your ankle on those) and stones and branches at the inconvenient level of your
      knees. There is an electricity tower you can see in the distance, that's your next target and rest stop. After the tower continue
      upwards and upwards until the trail begins to clear up just a bit with vegetation changing to dwarf bamboo. You'll also start noticing
      small lakes around. You're getting close to your first peak above 3000m on this trail, Kaheer Mt (卡賀爾山) at 3105m. It's a curious
      peak, or rather a collection of peaks. The trail doesn't go through any of them, but it's only about 2m hike up to grab it. After this
      mountain you'll have to go down a bit and start another climb, this time finally to the main peak of Nenggao Mt (能高山) and your
      first Top 100 mountain on this trip. The mountains look close to each other on the map, but it still took us over 2h to reach the
      peak. By the time we got there the weather cleared up a bit, but at the same time it was getting late and we had to hurry to our first
      campground, the China Lake (大陸池).
    </p>
    <p>
      The descent from Nenggao is as annoying as the ascent was. You'll notice plenty of small lakes around and if you're coming on busy
      weekend like we did there'll be plenty of tents strewn across the mountain. If it's getting dark it's better you find a spot to camp here,
      there should be plenty of water around if you don't come in dry season. We pushed on downhill with an occasional flattening or a minor
      bump, pushing through the undergrowth until we got a glimpse of our campground. The small area that hosts China lake is shaped
      similarly to Kaheer mountain, with sharp peaks around it. You're spend your first night inside a mountain crown. By the time we got
      there it was pretty dark and most level spaces were taken, but one friendly porter invited us to share the space next to his tent.
      The water from the lake is drinkable if you treat it, but it's so dirty it clogged my filter pretty quick.
      After a short bite it was late enough that the whole campground was asleep so we tucked in as well.

    <h2>Day 2</h2>
    <p>
      I think it was as early as 2AM when first hikers woke up and started eating their breakfast. We didn't sleep much the last few hours
      because of all the commotion, but got about an hour in after most of the hikers left - right before sunset. The friendly porter next
      tent over shared his water with us, they had enough from the fresh water source down the western slope of this hill. I haven't checked
      the water source so I'm unable to provide concrete directions. As we were preparing to leave we noticed small colourful dots on the
      next mountain - those were early risers still fighting with Nenggao South peak. We knew this would be a tough climb, but with the
      morning sun and a bit of sleep we were sure we could conquer it no problem.
    </p>
    <p>
      From the campground the trail is quite even for a while before starting the climb. There is a lot of overgrowth, but not more than the
      previous day. After a while you'll hit a few tricky bits with ropes, stash your poles so that they don't get in the way and push on.
      There is one or two sections here where it's better to wait for the previous hiker to finish their climb due to falling rocks. Apart
      from that all you can do here is climb, it'll take a while. When you reach the top you should be able to see the peak. You won't be
      there yet, but you got the hardest parts done. Take a rest here, grab a bite and enjoy the view as it is magnificent on a clear day.
      If you look back you'll notice the campground in the saddle between this mountain and Nenggao Main Peak that you've done yesterday.
      Further on Nanhua and Qilai peaks extending to Qilai East Ridge on the East. Closer to you the Ganzhuowan (干卓萬) range will come
      into view. It took us about 2h to get to the South Peak from here, the sun was incredibly strong and we were resting at every shaded
      location we could find. Similarly to Kaheer Mt, the peak of Nenggao South is a very short trek out of the main trail. Drop your bags,
      grab the peak and again enjoy the wonderful views from here. This is the highest you're going to be on this trip as the South Peak is
      higher than the main, sitting at 3349m. It's also one of the Top 100, one of the two we'd do on this day.
    </p>
    <p>
      After a proper lunch break (nothing beats a sandwich with fresh tomato!) it was time to head down the mountain. As you start your
      descend you'll notice a few peaks spread around in front of you - the last of those peaks is your next target. Before reaching
      it you'll have to go all the way down to the valley. This descent is very steep and seemed more painful than the way up.
      There's a lot of big holes here so be careful and take your time. There's a campgroun at the bottom, but more importantly if you turn
      left (east) you should eventually hit fresh water. There's still a few hours ahead of you and not many water sources so make sure you get plenty.
    </p>
    <p>
      Another climb awaits, luckily not as steep as the last one. You'll reach a peak eventually, the bad news is that's not the peak you
      want. The good news is this was your last serious climb for the day since Guangtou Mt (光頭山) is actually lower than this one. In
      fact there's a bunch of peaks here, but for some reason the peak marker is not on any of them. In any case continue downhill, steep in
      places, until you hit a small campground on the left before a small uphill. Continue up and tread along until you hit another small campground,
      also on your left. Continue for a very short while here and you should see some mud on the path - there is a small water source around
      here, should you need it. Not far from here you'll see people on the peak. Actually you'll see people, but not really a peak. I
      honestly don't know what's up with this mountain. Take the pictures of your third Top 100 peak and the last one for the day. It was
      quite late at this time so we hurried on to the campsite.
    </p>
    <p>
      The downhill from Guangtou starts with a tall cliff, we hit a small traffic jam here and had to wait for a few people to get down. Be
      careful here! About a week after our trip someone fell here and needed helicopter rescue. Be sure to stash your poles, use both arms to
      hold the line and make your way down slowly. There is a small landslide section after the cliff, but after that another gruelling
      downhill begins, it'll take about an hour of fighting through the undergrowth but eventually you'll see the tents scattered in front
      of Baishi lake (白石池). We arrived at the campsite around 5PM, happy to see Ada and Peggy again. There is plenty of lakes here, but
      there's also a water source around. Looking back on it I'm not sure it's worth the visit, particularly when it's
      cloudy. It's pretty far, tricky to find and it's lake water anyway since it's a lake outlet. With the whole area being relatively flat and full
      of lakes it can be really difficult to find your way back when clouds roll in. In fact someone got lost that evening and it took the
      porters a while to find him. Unless the weather is crystal clear and you don't mind the hike, filter the water from the big lake.
      As the night approached, we realised we're not alone. To be fair though this is what some people are here for and what this trail is known
      for - the Sambar deer. They're all used to people, unfortunately they got used to hikers feeding them. I need to make that note here:
      as with any wildlife make sure you don't feed the deers, try not to scare or touch them either. Occasionally they'll approach you,
      usually in small groups. Don't be alarmed, they're quite big, but completely harmless. When you go to sleep make sure all your food
      and other items are inside the tent. Not under the vestibule, they'll grab that, inside the tent proper.
