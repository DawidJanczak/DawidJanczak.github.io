    <h2>Getting there and Parking</h2>
    The hike is usually done North to South. The North entrance is at Tunyuan/屯原:<br>

    The end is at Aowanda/奧萬大:<br>

      It's difficult to do this hike without a car. Like always you can try hitchhiking, but the road
      from the north is pretty much used by hikers only. Aowanda is quite popular so it might be
      easier to hitch a ride from there. If you drive your own car you'll still need a driver to
      drive you back to your car. There are a few small parking lots at the entrance, but on busy
      weekends it might be difficult to find a spot. Keep going up until you find something. Make
      sure you don't block other cars. Another option is parking in Aowanda and having a driver help
      to get you to the entrance. This is less optimal for a few reasons:

        <li>
          There is a fee to enter Aowanda. You can always park on the road outside of the park,
          but there isn't that many spots and it means more walking after you finish.
        </li>

          If weather turns bad and you need to retreat you'll have to use the driver again to get
          back to your car.

      Depending on your itinerary or speed you might have to stay a night somewhere close to the
      entrance. A good option is Lushan Hot Spring Village (廬山

Hike begins with a wide path climbing slowly to the first observation platform,
the ocean should be visible even in a cloudy weather. After that the road
narrows a bit until it joins with another trail from the left and becomes what
had to be an old road across what is now a lemon farm. After a while the East
Rift Valley becomes visible on the left. You'll eventually hit another
observation deck, but because of tall vegetation it no longer serves its
purpose. It's a good resting spot should you be tired, probably better than the
forested peak itself. Shortly after the viewing platform split you'll enter a
lovely forest where the trail will go down slowly and then up to the peak. The
trail continues after this to the Northern entrance, but I'm not sure what its
condition is and in any case you'd need transportation on the other side.

The width of the trail might make this a good trail running option. Starting at
one entrance (South or North) one can run to the other and back. Should be less
than 10km (TODO double check) total.
