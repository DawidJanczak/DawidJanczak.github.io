    <h2>Before you begin</h2>
    <h3>Trail entrances</h3>
    The hike is usually done North to South. The North entrance is at Tunyuan/屯原:<br>

    </ul>
    The end is at Aowanda/奧萬大:<br>

    </ul>
    <h3>Transportation</h3>
    <p>
      It's difficult to do this hike without a car. Like always you can try hitchhiking, but the road
      from the north is pretty much used by hikers only. Aowanda is quite popular so it might be
      easier to hitch a ride from there. If you drive your own car you'll still need a driver to
      drive you back to your car. There are a few small parking lots at the entrance, but on busy
      weekends it might be difficult to find a spot. Keep going up until you find something. Make
      sure you don't block other cars. Another option is parking in Aowanda and having a driver help
      to get you to the entrance. This is less optimal for a few reasons:
      <ol>
        <li>
          There is a fee to enter Aowanda. You can always park on the road outside of the park,
          but there isn't that many spots and it means more walking after you finish.
        </li>
        <li>
          If weather turns bad on first or early second day and you need to retreat you'll have to
          use the driver again to get back to your car.
        </li>
      </ol>
    </p>
    <h3>Accommodation</h3>
    <p>
      Depending on your itinerary or speed you might have to stay a night somewhere close to the
      entrance. A good option is Lushan Hot Spring Village (廬山溫泉), it has a lot of hotels and
      B&amp;Bs with different pricing. We stayed at
      <a href="https://goo.gl/maps/gAJwQx9DXBDsFSmn7">Lilai Hot Spring Hotel</a> Like a lot of
      hotels in Taiwan the place isn't great, but it's cheap and breakfast is provided as early at
      night as you want. It also has small bathtub with hot spring water in the room. After the hike
      you can come back here and take a shower for 100NT.
