My name is Dawid (yes, with a w) and I am an avid hiker and trail runner. Having discovered Taiwan a decade ago I kept coming back for
more and eventually decided to settle in this beautiful country. Ever since my first high mountain hike to Yushan National Park I've been
focusing on collectiong the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/100_Peaks_of_Taiwan" class="underline">100 Peaks of Taiwan</a>(百岳, pronounced bǎiyuè),
a set of the most beautiful high mountains of this island.
