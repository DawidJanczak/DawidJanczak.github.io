        <p class="font-bold">This is a very fast and extremely difficult multi day hike</p>
        <p class="text-sm">
          It normally requires 10 days and we managed to cover it in half of that time. I do not recommend planning for anything shorter
          than 9 days unless your fitness, experience level and equipment allows it. Also, regardless of the itinerary, you need to keep in
          mind that this is the longest and most remote cross trail of the Taiwanese Top 100. We didn't meet a single soul on the whole
          trail and had no reception the first two days followed by only bits of reception later on. For all these reasons I recommend
          attempting this only after clearing the other sections. Make sure
          everyone in your group is similarly experienced, also you might consider hiring a porter if you have a big group. Be sure to bring some
          kind of GPS communicator or a PLB in case things go wrong. Finally the last section of this trail
          is (at the moment of writing, October 2020) a choice of crossing an extremely dilapidated suspension bridge (officially closed) or
          bushwacking through an alternative trail that hasn't been prepared properly followed by crossing a big river. See
          <a href="day-4">Day 4</a> description. Be sure to check <a href="#alternatives" class="underline">alternative itineraries</a>.

  <h3 id="trail-entrances" class="text-2xl font-semibold">Trail entrances</h3>
  <p>
    The hike is usually done east to west. The east entrance is around 19th km of Ruisui Forest Road (瑞穗林道), where the road crosses the
    river:
    <ul>
      <li><a href="https://www.openstreetmap.org/#map=21/23.53489/121.27444&layers=C">OpenStreetMap</a></li>

    </ul>
  </p>
  <p>
    The west entrance is on the 33km of Junda Forest Road (郡大林道), also around an old bridge:

    </ul>
  </p>
  <h3 id="transportation" class="text-2xl font-semibold">Transportation</h3>
  <p>
    Both ends require 4WD cars to get to so you'll have to reserve two. The east end is more tricky as it's not used often,
    but on the west end you could technically try your luck and go down 1-2km to the entrance of nearby Junda Mt (郡大山). On the weekends
    it's full of cars waiting for hikers doing that mountain and one of them could potentially help you down, but it's down to luck and
    after such a long hike it's better not to risk it. In addition Junda Road has a checkpoint and your police permit <em>will</em> be
    checked so make sure you have it on you.
  </p>
  <p>
    There isn't much reception on the trail and the best times to contact the driver and confirm your ETA is around the last few peaks,
    namely Zhu (櫧山) and Wushuang mountains, including the top portions of the long downhill from the latter. After getting down to the
    valley it is unlikely you'll get any reception.
  </p>
  <h3 id="accommodation" class="text-2xl font-semibold">Accommodation</h3>
  <p>
    We stayed around Ruisui Station (瑞穗車站) before the first day, there's plenty of B&amp;Bs there. Another
    option would be to arrive in Ruisui in the morning, start the hike on the same day and sleep relatively close to the entrance.
    A good choice for the first night is an old cabin at 28km of the forest road, it took us about 2h30m to reach it from the entrance.
  </p>

<section class="mt-5 space-y-6">
  <h2 id="the-hike" class="text-4xl font-bold">The Hike</h2>
  <h3 id="day-1" class="text-2xl font-semibold">Day 1</h3>
  <p>
    After a short sleep we left our B&amp;B in Ruisui at 3AM. I was hoping to doze off more on the car, but I was probably too excited for
    what was about to happen. I was finally on route to what was supposed to be the most difficult hike in Taiwan.
  </p>
  <p>
    "10 days?! Are you sure?" I asked Andy a few years prior, just to make sure he didn't make a mistake when describing this trail. Taiwanese
    trails tend to be remote, but the island is so small I found this timeframe a bit odd. It then took a bit of planning with him to see how
    it can be squeezed into a shorter period. We settled on 5 days with a possibility of shortening to 4, but prepared to do 6 if something goes wrong.
    Given how remote and long this trail was there was one thing I was absolutely
    sure of &mdash; I'm not doing this alone. Luckily Petr &mdash; the Head Beast of <a href="https://beast.run/">Taiwan Beast Runners</a> &mdash; had the same thoughts about
    doing this alone so we ended up teaming for this one. In fact Petr helped me with another bit of this trail before, namely looking for
    alternative trail at the end bypassing Wushuang Bridge, but more on that later.
  </p>
  <p>
    Not being able to sleep I was trying to spot the km markers on the road. 11, 12, 13km... The mighty Delica crossed a few streams on the
    road and I asked the driver if it's always like this. "No", he replied, "it's just that there's been a lot of rain lately". That's both
    good and bad &mdash; we wouldn't have to worry about the water availability, but we can't be sure it wouldn't rain more. 17, 18, 19km,
    almost there. At around 19.3km mark there is an old concrete bridge that marks the end of this ride. Having arrived there we grabbed our
    stuff and I noticed a few leeches in the back of the car. Great, here we go. I always get a few of these little critters in the east. Little did
    I know this trip would be a bit different in that regard. After the driver left we noticed that the bridge had lots of water running not
    only under, but more importantly over it. It's always funny how you avoid water in the first few meters of the hike/run knowing
    perfectly well that in a few kms your shoes will be fully wet anyway.
  </p>
  <p>
    There is a bit of road after the bridge still, but very soon after you're essentially climbing up a small river. Switchbacks follow and
    it's really easy to get lost here. Be careful if you're here at night and/or when it's raining. Backtrack if you hit a dead end, we had
    to do that once or twice. It's just climbing up for now, but after a while the road widens again and it's quite a pleasant hike. You hit
    a river or a landslide here and there, but generally the trail is good enough to cover many kms in a short time.
  </p>
  <p>
    There is a surprisingly clean old cabin at 28km mark where hikers doing 10 day itinerary spend their first night. We rested here for a
    bit checking the detailed (even in English) map on its wall and continued after a while.
  </p>
  <aside class="bg-blue-100 ml-5 p-3">
    The map mentioned above explains the marking on the trail quite well. You'll be following yellow rhombus shaped markings that you should
    theoretically see every 100m. In reality a lot of them are missing so as always look for the ribbons. There are other markings that are
    quite specific to this trail:
    <ul class="list-disc list-inside">
      <li>
        Red rhombus marks a section of a massive Central Mountain Range trail that goes north to south and whose one section is on
        between Danda and Yixiqingmazhi Mountains. From Danda it connects to Liushun Mountain and from Yixiqingmazhi it goes to Mabolasi
        range. Make sure you don't follow this on either ends, stick to the yellow plaques.
      </li>
      <li>
        Blue plaques mark water location. Often times they'll be right next to the river, but sometimes you'll have to hike out of the main
        trail to get water. There will usually be a sign mentioning how long it takes to get to the water, I'll also note that in the blog.
      </li>
      <li>
        Yellow plaques with a horizontal cross-through (not mentioned on the map) are secondary markings to mountains that lie a bit outside
        of the main trail. You'll see them on Neilinger and Dongluanda Mountains, follow them to the peak and then back the same way you
        came.
      </li>
    </ul>
  </aside>
  <p>
    It's been raining since we started, but it
    starts getting worse after we leave the cabin. And around this time we notice the first invaders on our legs. There are a few ways to
    remove them, most common being spraying them with salt or treating them with fire from a lighter. Salt was deep in our backpacks and
    lighter might not work in this rain so Petr had an idea to use the sunscreen spray he brought over. That ended up working just fine and
    that small bottle of sunscreen would end up being our best friend for the day.
  </p>
  <aside class="bg-blue-100 ml-5 p-3">
    I did some research after the hike and it turns out none of these approaches are recommended because they all agitate the leech and
    might force it to vomit into the wound and potentially cause infections before it detaches. The now recommended way to remove a leech is to locate its
    sucker end and put a fingernail between it and your skin and then flick it. There's plenty of resources on this online, make sure you acquaint yourself
    with this method. Wearing an insect repellant on you might help as well.
  </aside>
  <p>
    There are three more buildings at 32k mark, around 4km from the first one. The weather was getting worse so we decided to take a rest
    here. It takes a while to get used to the stench permeating the hut, but getting out of the rain makes it worth it. We removed the
    newest party of leeches, grabbed some food and headed out shortly after. At around 34k mark the trail splits.
  </p>
  <p>
    There are two options here: one flat, traversing the mountain and the other going up the mountain. We should have realised something was wrong
    with the traverse since according to the map it takes roughly the same time as the other trail and that one climbs almost 500m. We decided to
    traverse since this was supposed to be the more official trail and who wants to climb an insignificant peak if they don't have to
    anyway? Well the traverse is terrible. We got lost pretty much straight off the bat, around 50m in. The trail is not clearly visible,
    the ribbons are sparse and the whole mountain is overgrown. It gets just a little bit better
    later, but in general it's still a really bad trail. I haven't taken the other one so can't say what its condition is, but it can't be
    worse than this. If you don't mind the climb consider the alternative. Oh I almost forgot: there's water a few meters into the traverse
    trail so make sure you refill here.
  </p>
  <p>
    After what seems like forever we eventually reached a nicer forest and a very comfortable campground. At this point we could hear the
    river so we knew we were close to what was supposed to be our emergency campground in case time was running out. There are two streams
    here, both with campgrounds. You'll cross the Taiping East Stream (太平溪東源) first, there's a very small campground on the other side.
    Keep going and cross Taiping West Stream (太平溪西源), a bit more difficult crossing but with a better campground. If water level is too
    high or there's no space you can climb just a little bit to a huge rock, there's a bit of space to set up a tent next to it as well. We
    took an afternoon tea break here and, as is now tradition, removed about a million leeches from ourselves.
  </p>
  <p>
    What follows is quite a big climb, but on the plus side trail condition gets better. Our final campground is again right next to the
    west stream (the second one we crossed), just much closer to the source. That can get a bit confusing since there are now two campgrounds that can be referred to as
    Taiping West Stream Campground (太平溪西源營地) and they're a good few hours apart from each other (in fact according to the map the
    section between the streams is supposed to take a whole day!). After the peak the trail gets a bit more overgrown again as you traverse
    the mountain in a slightly downhill manner. Eventually you'll reach the river again. The campground is still almost half an hour away
    upstream, but it's right next to the river so you don't necessarily need to fetch water from here. Consider doing that though if you're
    doing this in dry season, there might be none up there in this case. You'll have to cross the river and follow it on the other side for
    a while. The trail will shortly get back to the river and cross it twice so eventually you'll still have the river on your left as you
    continue up. Shortly after that you'll see what looks like a campground, but continue on to the actual one, much bigger than this.
    You'll know you're there when you see signs for Danda Mountain (丹大山) since the campground is at the intersection. Cross the dry
    riverbed and look for a good spot close to the second stream. Day 1 ends here.
  </p>
</section>
<section class="mt-5 space-y-6">
  <h3 id="day-2" class="text-2xl font-semibold">Day 2</h3>
  <p>
    Given the distance we had to cover daily we decided we'd wake up at 4 every day and hike the first hour in the dark. It was autumn so
    days were getting shorter and sunrise was happening around 5. Well on this particular day it felt like it never happened at all.
  </p>
  <p>
    We left the campground just before 5, carrying only essentials in a small backpack. Crossing the dry river next to the campground again,
    we turned left and started gradual climb towards the peak Lulilaluo Mountain (盧利拉駱山), a minor peak on the way to the main mountain.
    After the peak another mountain appears, but it's only after that that we were able to see Danda. It's a big mountain, it's grouped in
    the "Nine Walls" category of Baiyue along with Pingfeng (屏風山) and a few others. You won't see the peak from this perspective yet,
    after climbing the mountain you'll need to walk on the ridge a bit to reach the highest point. From here one can continue along the
    massive ridge north all the way to Liushun Mountain (六順山), Seven Colour Lake (七彩湖) and Danda Forest Road (丹大林道). That's
    a trip for another time. We took a few pictures in the cloudy skies, but it was too cold to stay on the peak for too long so we headed
    back. After about an hour we were back at the campsite and had a proper breakfast while packing.
  </p>
  <p>
    What follows is a steep climb to an intersection next to Neilinger Mountain and that breakfast we had really helped with it. You'll run
    into a campground or two on the way, look for the one where roads split - left to Neilinger Mountain and right to continue on the ridge.
    We dropped our bags here and went to grab the peak, it's a pleasant and quite a flat walk to the mountain. The sun was still stubbornly
    hiding behind clouds so we didn't spend much time here either and backtracked to the intersection.
  </p>
  <p>
    What follows is the ridge to Yixiqingmazhi Mt with a few peaks on the way. It was about the time we got to the most prominent one,
    Malubalarang Mt (馬路巴拉讓山), when it started raining. As we continued the rain would only get stronger so the stop at Yixiqingmazhi
    was quite brief. This is the other end of the split between South Third Section and the Central Mountain Range trail, from here one can
    continue to Mabolasi (馬博拉斯) in the south. Make sure you turn right here and continue with the yellow markers. There's a few more
    peaks left, but eventually we reached our final one for the day - Limen Mt (裏門山).
  </p>
  <p>
    I took my phone out to take some pictures and noticed a message. Reception! Ever since leaving Ruisui we had no reception, not on the
    forest road, not on the peaks, nothing. Finally it seemed like we're getting some, but after running around the mountain trying to find
    the signal we realised it's not going to happen again. We really wanted to let our partners and emergency contacts know everything is
    fine, but would have to wait a bit more for that. The sun decided to show up just before disappearing behind the horizon, better than
    nothing I guess. We grabbed our bags and headed down the mountain to our campground at Danda River (丹大溪源營地). By the time we
    arrived in the valley it was getting dark so we grabbed some water, set up our tents and after a quick dinner went to sleep.
  </p>
</section>
<section class="mt-5 space-y-6">
  <h3 id="day-3" class="text-2xl font-semibold">Day 3</h3>
  <p>
    This campsite was more humid than the other and the tents were all wet when we woke up around 4. We packed quickly and started hiking
    hoping that today would be better. The night sky was perfectly clear and while that made the night colder it was a good sign that the
    sun would stay with us during the day.
  </p>
  <p>
    The beginning of the day is quite easy, a few small climbs on bamboo covered hills. Not even an hour after we left the sun rose and
    exposed the mountains we'd have to climb. The ridge we had in front of us hosted the highest peak of this climb and indeed the ridge
    itself seemed much higher than what we hiked the day before. We decided to take a short breakfast break basking in the morning sun and
    braved the climb shortly after that.
  </p>
  <p>
    The first peak is called Tiannankelan (天南可蘭山) and is a short 5 min trek outside of the main trail. The mountain turned out to be
    incredibly important for us, we finally got proper reception and could contact our loved ones. Oddly enough the signal would disappear
    as soon as we left the peak and we wouldn't get it back until the next day. Continuing from this peak we cross a few others, including
    Kelekelean (可樂可樂安山) and Jundong (郡東山) mountains. Before leaving the latter Petr noticed a backpack on the ground. It seemed
    like it was left there recently, had a rain cover on but not much inside. We called for other people, but there was no response. Later
    on we would find out that someone had to be rescued from this mountain in the beginning of the month and for some reason they left the
    backpack behind.
  </p>
  <p>
    The next peak is the big one, Dongjunda Mt sitting at 3619m. Before that there is a big descent down a valley hosting a really nice
    campground and a water source. The riverbed starts quite high, but it's usually dry so one can camp here, but there is a much nicer
    campground closer to the water source down below. We refilled our water down there and started the climb. This one takes a while, it's
    over 300m. Towards the end you'll notice another mountain on the right, the other Top 100 of today lies behind it. There is a nice
    campground very close to the peak and we took a bit of time to set up the wet tent and gear hoping it would dry in the time it would
    take us to hike Dongluanda Mt (東巒大山). The peak would remain covered in clouds most of that time, but the wind helped a bit.
  </p>
  <p>
    The hike down to Dongluanda is wonderful, nothing but short bamboo. There is a nice mountain on the way called Wudapei (烏達佩山), the
    peak situated on a rock slightly outside of the trail. Before you reach the peak there is a side trail down another valley to get water.
    We didn't need any and according to the signage it's quite a hike at 50 mins there and back. After the intermediate peak you go down
    again and back up Dongluanda. The weather was getting cloudy here as well so we didn't stay long. Back at the intersection campground we
    packed our gear, had our afternoon tea and went on to grab the pyramid shaped peak of Dongjunda. We didn't collect this peak before
    hoping the clouds would clear up a bit. They did, but just a bit. Again we noticed some reception on the peak, but it was too
    intermittent for any communication. It was getting late and we still had one mountain to cross before we reached our campground.
  </p>
  <p>
    The downhill here is actually quite complicated, there were times we couldn't find the next ribbon in all the undergrowth. Eventually we
    reached the saddle and another climb starts. It's only about 200m, but at this time I was ridiculously tired from all the climbs, it
    took me a while to reach the peak. The mountain itself has a beautiful meadow on the west side illuminated by the setting sun at
    this time. The east side on the other hand is an enormous landslide, looking quite ominuous in the darkness. The downhill after the peak
    leads to another campsite with some pools, but we pressed on to the next campground that was supposed to have fresh water. There is an
    intersection at the bottom of the valley where the blue plaques on the left will take you down the water source and going right leads to
    the campsite.
  </p>
  <p>
    We dropped our bags at the intersection and headed down to fetch the water. The signage said 50 mins and at this time it was already
    dark, we really hoped the rain from the days before would make the river start higher. That wasn't the case, it took us good 20 mins of
    steep descent to reach a small stream. We filled the water and started heading back up eventually reaching the split and heading down to
    the campground to finish our day.

  <p>
    We started out before 5 as usual climbing the nearby Zhu Mt (櫧山), a very pleasant uphill hike. As we went up the sun started coming out behind us
    and by the time we reached the peak it was welcoming enough to take a break and have some breakfast. This would have been our highest
    peak of the day. The final Top 100, Wushuang Mt, is actually lower than this one. After quick breakfast in a relatively cold morning
    still we headed down to the valley and started the climb to the first of many peaks of Wushuang Mt, Wushuan East Peak (無雙東峰).
  </p>
  <aside class="bg-blue-100 ml-5 p-3">
    Wushuang Mt doesn't look interesting from afar, but boy it's one hell of a mountain. When crossing it from the east you pass the East
    Peak, then the highest point and finally the actual peak. Yes, the actual peak is not the highest point. It also has the worst view of the
    three, no view in fact. All peaks require rock scrambling and we're very happy to be doing this in sunny weather and with light backpacks. Doing this
    with heavy packs and/or in the rain would be much bigger challenge. If you brought your hiking poles they'll be in the way throughout
    this whole mountain, probably better to stash them.
  </aside>
  <p>
    When I reached the East Peak Petr was already there and with a calm "Not yet" pointed to the highest peak. I forgot about the east one
    and for some reason assumed we'd do the highest one first. On the plus side by the time we got there the sun was pretty high up and we decided to take a
    longer break and dry all our gear while having second breakfast and coffee. This was probably the best moment of the whole trip.
    Past days and nights were wet and unpleasant and here we were getting burnt by the sun and having coffee, only one day from the end of
    the trip. After all our equipment dried out it was time to move on. We climbed the highest peak, even more technically difficult than
    the previous one, and continued on to the main one. After the final climb you reach what seems like a peak, but you bypass it. This is 
    <em>not</em> the main peak! There are trails that lead up there, but the main peak is directly on the trail, just a bit farther.
  </p>
  <p>
    After grabbing some photos it was time to head down. This is a long, but beautiful, downhill. The elevation drops almost 1500m just to
    get to the first campground and continues dropping, albeit more gradually, after that. The mountain is covered with evergreen and it's
    easy to slip on the tree needles so be careful here. It took us about 2h to reach the Yalishi campground (亞力士營地), first of many
    settlements we'd pass on the way out. Just before the campground we crossed a river and refilled our water. 
  </p>
  <p>
    There is a huge landslide after the campground, you'll need to climb up a bit in order to bypass it. It's not a huge climb, but it was around noon for us and
    the sun was merciless. After that it's just a long traverse, sometimes going slightly up, sometimes down and bypassing many old
    Bunun settlements from way back when. Eventually you'll reach the biggest of them all: Wushuang village. I've seen many small abandonded
    villages on my hikes, but nothing this big. We even found some walnuts to munch on.
  </p>
  <p>
    Shortly after the village we could see the main obstacle of this hike: Wushuang suspension bridge (無雙吊橋). It's the third time I'm
    here and the bridge gets worse and worse as years go by. First time I came here was on what was supposed to be a routine hike. I didn't
    know about the suspension bridge and when I saw it I stopped dead in my tracks. This was an obstacle I would not be crossing.
    A few years later me and Petr came here to look for an alternative trail. We knew some people take an old road connecting the bridge
    from the eastern side to hot springs down in the river, further north. That trail was terrible, but still better to bushwack than cross
    that derelict. In addition just before leaving for this hike I noticed people posting photos of this bypass on social media, complete with
    an information board and additional plaques supposedly leading the way. Well the board is there all right, so are the plaques. Three of
    them to be exact. That's how many we managed to find when looking for the way. The trail is still overgrown and only a handful of
    ribbons appear occasionally to help or, in some cases, further confuse us. The section from the bridge is over 2km long and it took us
    well over an hour to cover it. That's keeping in mind we knew the trail. If you choose this route over the bridge keep in mind it will
    probably take you about 2h and you don't want to do this when it's dark. At the end one final obstacle remains: you need to cross a
    relatively strong river. Again there are some plaques there telling you to be careful and not to cross when the river is high, but
    really at this point there's no turning back. I'm sure eventually some hiking angels
    will clean up the trail, add more ribbons and perhaps at least a rope to help crossing the river, but at the moment of writing this bit
    alone makes the whole South Third Section dangerous enough for me to discourage anyone from doing it.
  </p>
  <p>
    The good news is that after you cross the river, if you're lucky, you'll be able to immerse yourself in a hot spring. When we came here
    with Petr a few years back the hot spring was in a wonderful condition and we were hoping for the same this time. It was supposed to be
    the highlight of the trip as there's nothing better than a hot spring after a few days in the mountains. Alas, this time it wasn't meant
    to be. The river must have destroyed the man-made "tub" we used last time and the most we could do is soak our feet in the hot water.
    Still we were done with the day and had enough time to set up a fire in our campground, we spent the rest of the evening eating dinner
    and enjoying the warmth of the fire. I slept like a baby this night, nothing like a dry and warm campsite after all these cold and wet
    nights.

  <p>
    We scheduled our driver to arrive at noon, but we weren't sure we'd make it because of the climb. We were now in the river at around
    1400m and had to climb back up to the forest road at around 2500m. We started the day a bit earlier because of that.

    The hike took us 4 days. Despite many hikers on that weekend taking 4 days as well, this is considered fast by some. Here is an analysis
    of total time and possible suggestions for more and less days.
  </p>
  <p>
    First a quick analysis: the total map time is 41h 13min. It took us a bit longer at 43h 26min. The actual day lengths were as follows:
    <ol>
      <li>Day 1: 13h 11m</li>
      <li>Day 2: 10h 24m</li>
      <li>Day 3: 10h 49m</li>
      <li>Day 4: 09h 02m</li>
    </ol>
    First day being the longest, the remaining ones are split evenly enough. If you plan to do 4 days stick to this plan. I'll derive the
    plans below splitting map time into day chunks as evenly as possible. Also all of these plans assume river trail at the end, mountain
    trail adds about 25mins.
  </p>
  <h3 id="alt-6-days" class="text-2xl font-semibold">6 days</h3>
  <p>
    For 6 days the average day is 6h 52m long assuming map speed.
    <ol class="list-decimal list-inside">
      <li>First night lands somewhere around the monument. If you have time push to the electricity tower or Kaheer Mt. Probably a good idea
      to carry water from the cabin. A more comfortable alternative would be to stay at the cabin and walk a bit more the next day.</li>
      <li>The South Peak seems to be the limit here, camp at China Lake.</li>
      <li>One of the campsites between South Peak and Guangtou Mt, after the valley campsite. First one is called 3159 peak campsite
        (despite being quite a distance from the peak), second doesn't have a name.</li>
      <li>Camp before Andongjun Mt, no need to get the peak today but feel free to if you have time</li>
      <li>Bottom of the river, where river and mountain trail splits. There's a good campsite on the other side of the river, no need to
        camp inside it. The times here assume you'll take river trail, you'll have to </li>
    </ol>
  </p>
  <h3 id="alt-5-days" class="text-2xl font-semibold">5 days</h3>
  <p>
    For 5 days the average day is 8h 15m long assuming map speed.
    <ol class="list-decimal list-inside">
      <li>You'll need to camp after the cabin. Push as much as you can, Kaheer is a good option here.</li>
      <li>This might be a longer day, you'll need to make it to the campsite after the South Peak.</li>
      <li>Wanli Lake, after Baishi Mt.</li>
      <li>Second Hunter's campground.</li>
    </ol>
  </p>
  <h3 id="alt-3-days" class="text-2xl font-semibold">3 days</h3>
  <div role="alert">
    <div class="bg-red-500 text-white font-bold rounded-t px-4 py-2">
      For trail runners with high mountain experience only!
    </div>
    <div class="border border-t-0 border-red-400 rounded-b bg-red-100 px-4 py-3 text-red-700">
      Do not attempt this unless you're an experienced and fast trail runner, having done a few easier runs or fast hikes in the high
      mountains. Depending on your speed and the date of the hike you might have to start before sunrise and end after sunset.
    </div>
  </div>
  <p>
    This is where things get interesting, 3 days should be possible for the faster folks. Most of this trail is not runnable so you'll have to fast hike it.
    The runnable sections include the Nenggao Cross Trail until the Monument, some parts of Guangtou Mt and the long section between Baishi
    Lake and Andongjun Mt.
    Downhill is very technical, but after that you could try and run the river and the trails that follows. That all being said you'll have to
    bring a bigger backpack so running might not be a good option, fast hiking should still get you through in 3 days. There is another
    small difficulty at the end of the trail since Aowanda park will probably be closed by the time you finish. You might have to walk all the way to the
    exit instead of Tourist Centre, that's another 1-2km on the road.
  </p>
  <p>
    Campsites for first and second night
    <ol class="list-decimal list-inside">
      <li>China Lake, same as in 4 day itinerary. It would be great if you could camp after South Peak, but that's probably too much.</li>
      <li>Tunlu lake.</li>
    </ol>
