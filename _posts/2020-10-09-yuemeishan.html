Difficulty: 2/5
Nr of days: 1

Hike begins with a wide path climbing slowly to the first observation platform,
the ocean should be visible even in a cloudy weather. After that the road
narrows a bit until it joins with another trail from the left and becomes what
had to be an old road across what is now a lemon farm. After a while the East
Rift Valley becomes visible on the left. You'll eventually hit another
observation deck, but because of tall vegetation it no longer serves its
purpose. It's a good resting spot should you be tired, probably better than the
forested peak itself. Shortly after the viewing platform split you'll enter a
lovely forest where the trail will go down slowly and then up to the peak. The
trail continues after this to the Northern entrance, but I'm not sure what its
condition is and in any case you'd need transportation on the other side.

The width of the trail might make this a good trail running option. Starting at
one entrance (South or North) one can run to the other and back. Should be less
than 10km (TODO double check) total.
