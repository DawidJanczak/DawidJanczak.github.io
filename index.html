<h1>Welcome to Taiwan Peaks!</h1>
<p>
  I created this website to document my hikes and help out fellow hikers discover the mountains of Taiwan. I realised there isn't that much
  information available in English and would like this to end up being a comprehensive guide to Taiwan's Top 100 peaks, as well as other
  &mdash; less important but equally beautiful &mdash; mountains.

  In particular I would like this to be helpful for the faster hikers or trail runners. There is a growing community of hikers and runners doing
  hikes that are traditionally multi-day, in a single day. Quite a lot of resources are now available in Chinese, but not that many in English. I am
  hoping the information you find here will be helpful to you regardless of your fitness level, I will do my best to provide alternative
  itineraries for those of you that would like to take their time, as well as those who are much faster than I am.
